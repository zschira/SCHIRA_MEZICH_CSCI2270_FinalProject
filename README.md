# SCHIRA_MEZICH_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project 

Summary

-This program will be an electronic score keeping program for a baseball game. Its function is to allow the user to manually input the lineup, keep track of the results of each at bat, and calculate the final score of the game as well as each batters individual averages. There will also be an option to simulate a full 9 inning game and display the results.

How to Run

-Download main.cpp, Baseball.cpp, and Baseball.h and add to a project in codeblocks

-run main 

-it will prompt user to either start a manual scorecard or to simulate a game

-if simulate game -> full 9 inning game will be simulated and results displayed

-if start new scorecard -> user will be prompted to create the lineups for both teams by entering the players numbers when prompted

                       -> then user will be prompted to enter what each batter did in their atbat as they come up to bat
                       
                       -> this will continue until 9 innings have been played and then final scores for each team will be displayed and averages for each player will be displayed

Open issues/bugs
Averages are not calculating properly
Simulation option not implemented yet

Phase 2 collaboration recommendation
fix averages
check that at bat result input is only an int between 0 and 4
