This program will be an electronic score keeping program for a baseball game.
Its function is to allow the user to manually input the lineup, keep track
of the results of each at bat, and calculate the final score of the game as 
well as each batters individual stats. There will also be an option to simulate 
a full 9 inning game and display the results.
